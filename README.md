## CCNA Lab: Complete Network Configuration

This repository documents a comprehensive CCNA lab I completed, covering topics like IPv4/IPv6, VLANs, EtherChannel, OSPF, DHCP, NAT, security features, wireless, and more.  
The lab is based on a tutorial by [Jeremyâ€™s IT Lab on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeremysITLab). I recreated the lab in Packet Tracer for personal study and practice.

## ðŸ§ª Lab Overview

The lab is divided into 9 parts, each focusing on specific networking concepts. Below are links to each part, detailing the steps I followed and the CLI commands I used.

- [Part 1: Initial Setup](part1/README.md) - Hostname, enable secret, user accounts, and console configuration.
- [Part 2: VLANs, Layer-2 EtherChannel](part2/README.md) - VLAN setup, EtherChannel configuration, trunking, and VTP.
- [Part 3: IP Addresses, Layer-3 EtherChannel, HSRP](part3/README.md) - IP addressing, Layer-3 EtherChannel, and HSRP for redundancy.
- [Part 4: Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol](part4/README.md) - Rapid PVST+ configuration, root bridge alignment, PortFast, and BPDU Guard.
- [Part 5: Static and Dynamic Routing](part5/README.md) - OSPF configuration, static default routes, and OSPF ASBR setup.
- [Part 6: Network Services](part6/README.md) - DHCP, DNS, NTP, SNMP, Syslog, FTP, SSH, and NAT/PAT configuration.
- [Part 7: Security: ACLs and Layer-2 Security Features](part7/README.md) - Extended ACLs, Port Security, DHCP Snooping, and DAI.
- [Part 8: IPv6](part8/README.md) - IPv6 addressing, routing, and static default routes.
- [Part 9: Wireless](part9/README.md) - Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) setup, dynamic interface, and WLAN configuration.
